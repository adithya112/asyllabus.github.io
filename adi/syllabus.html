	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>		Welcome to Introduction to CSS3. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a method of styling your HTML documents witvarious colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. But that is just the beginning. 		You can also do some "cool" stuff such as creating transitions or adding animations. There are so many things you can do with CSS, tat we focus on the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rules and syntax (how to write CSS code)</li>
			<li>simple styling (fonts, colors,borders)</li>
			<li>More styling(background images and opacity)</li>
			<li>Positioning - how to get the different parts ofyour page to go where you want them to go</li>
			<li>Psedo-classes - styling things that aren't even there!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the importance of accessibility. Not only will you style your site, but you will test it and oter sites on the POUR accessibility principles to ensure that your styling is enhancing your site, not putting up unseen roadblocks.

	<h2>How this course works:</h2>
	<p>This course assumes that you already know how to write HTML code and ready to style your pages. In eac module you will be asked to do the following:</p>
	<h3>Watch video lecture.</h3>
	<p>The information has been broken down into pieces to help you learn the material in the smallest chunks that still give you enough to do something with it. The goal is to give you ability to listen to these during any time you have. You will find that some of the videos have material that makes sense to you at once. Sometimes you may want to replay other videos to clarify the material.</p>
	<h3>Change the video speed to one that works best for you</h3>
	<p>You may find that you can speed the videos up and still retain the information. On the other hand, my mom is always telling me i talk too quickly... so you may find that you prefer to slow the videos down. The important things is to find something that works well for you. Use the in-video quizzes to help you guage how your learning is going.</p>
	<h3>Code with video lectures.</h3>
	<p>Some of the videos are not traditional lectures, instead they are videos where i demonstrate the concepts from an earlier lecture. I higly recommend that you code along with me while you watch these videos. <em><strong>The key to success in this course is in writing code.</strong></em> I put these videos in so that you have something specific to practice. It is also a great way for you to see how often i mess up when i am coding!! </p>
	<h3>Read extra materials</h3>
	<p>Each module will include reading material. It is immpossible to learn everything you need to just by listening to the lectures. There are suggested readings to go along with this course. I also encourage you to sekek out other resources online. Anyone who wants to work with technology needs to understand that it is important to update your skills.</p>
	<h3>Quizzes</h3>
	<p>The first three modules will each have a graded quiz. These quizzes are intended to reinforce your confidence in the material, not "trick" you. As often as possible each question will be linked to a specific lecture or reading. You can take the quizzes as many times as you like, but there is a limit on how many times you can take eac quiz in a cetain time period. Ocassionally i include an ungraded quiz to help stuents track their current progress and prepare them for the grade quiz.</p>

	<h3>Peer graded assignments</h3>
	<p>There will be thrhee peer graded assignments in this course: they are at the end of week one, week two, and week four. You are actually ready to start the final assessment by the end of the third week class, i just wanted to provide some examples to accompany the final project.</p>

		<h2>Optional material</h2>
		<p>There will also be optional material provided in many of the modules. These may range from links to recent articles to videos on pioneers in the fields of design and accessibility. None of these materials will be required for the quizzes, but rather provide additional ways for you to branc out and learn more about the history of the feild or the emerging ideas.</p>
